# Volcano-Simulation
This is my Final Proyect for "Computational Modeling of Movement" class.

This MATLAB code simulates the projectile motion of an object launched at a user-defined angle and initial velocity, accounting for drag forces. The trajectory is computed using numerical methods, and the final velocity is displayed. The code produces a visualization of the object's path on a grid.
